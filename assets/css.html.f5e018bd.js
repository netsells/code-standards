We utilise this at the source level and compile it ourselves with our own project-specific variables. This means we overwrite less of the bootstrap defaults in additional code, and means we can only import what our application needs to cut down the size of our compiled stylesheet. We make use of framework provided mixins to minimise DOM bloat by combining multiple mixins into a single semantic class name.</p><h2 id="linting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#linting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Linting</h2><p>We make use of an automated approach of enforcing CSS code standards. These standards are constantly evolving to ensure we are making use of the best methods, and in order to catch more edge cases ensuring our code is consistent across the board.</p>',7),u=s('<h2 id="class-and-id-casing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#class-and-id-casing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Class and ID casing</h2><p>Classes and IDs should always be hyphenated, as opposed to camelCase, snake_case or any mixture of the two.</p><h2 id="css-methodology" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#css-methodology" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CSS Methodology</h2><p>We don&#39;t clutter our CSS with any specific methodologies. When writing CSS in Vue components, they are namespaced or &quot;scoped&quot; by default to the elements in the current component. This means that it&#39;s highly unlikely that there will be style clashes.</p><p>Doing this allows us to concentrate on readable and meaningful class names without cluttering up the DOM or our source with manually namespaced selectors.</p><h2 id="nesting-and-awareness-of-specificity-levels" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nesting-and-awareness-of-specificity-levels" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nesting and Awareness of Specificity Levels</h2><p>When using Pre-processors such as SCSS, it&#39;s easy to get carried away with nesting selectors. This quickly adds up, and you end up with CSS rules which are almost impossible to override from external sources without bloating the selector with a higher specificity.</p><p>As a rule, selectors should not be nested unless they need to be. If styling within a scoped style block of a Vue component it&#39;s highly unlike that you will need to nested as the scope is contained to the elements in your components. It&#39;s often more beneficial to differentiate the conflicting elements by adding class names to the elements. If the above isn&#39;t possible, nesting is acceptable.</p><p>Nesting is always acceptable for pseudo classes, adjacent selectors and media queries.</p><h2 id="media-queries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#media-queries" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Media Queries</h2><p>Media queries should always go &quot;up&quot; by default, as defined by the mobile-first methodology. This enforces the flow of responsiveness to always be in the same direction.</p><p>Placement of media queries should be within the element being modified, rather than all being grouped under a single media query definition at the bottom of the file. This keeps all styling logic for each element together and reduces the odds of missing an existing rule for the element.</p>',12);function p(m,f){const t=i("RouterLink");return o(),n("div",null,[h,r("p",null,[e("See "),c(t,{to:"/frontend/linting/stylelint/"},{default:d(()=>[e("Stylelint")]),_:1}),e(".")]),u])}const y=a(l,[["render",p],["__file","css.html.vue"]]);export{y as default};
