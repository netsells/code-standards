# Hatchly

This section of documentation relates to the use of features within the Hatchly CMS platform developed by Netsells.

## Section and Attribute key casing

Section and attribute keys should always be lowercase and should follow the snake_case pattern. This makes it consistent with other object values, and allows consistent behaviour with when accessed from the page model (`$page->attribute`), via the `hatchly-pages-api` endpoint and when passing directly into javascript.
