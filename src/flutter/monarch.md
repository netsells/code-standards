# Monarch

[Monarch](https://monarchapp.io) is our preferred tool for previewing widgets in isolation. It includes a desktop app which allows you to create and view 'stories' without having to worry about dependencies.

Monarch allows you to either have stories within the `lib/` directory, or within their own top-level `stories/` directory. **We strongly prefer organising stories into a top-level `stories/` directory, with the directory structure mirroring that of the `lib/` directory.**

We don't require that stories be written for every single widget; we simply provide Monarch as an option to make life easier during development.

Please refer to the [Monarch documentation](https://monarchapp.io/docs) for more information on setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
