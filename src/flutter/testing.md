# Testing Flutter Apps

Comprehensive automated tests are a crucial component of a healthy codebase. Not only do they allow behaviour to be continuously verified as changes are made to a project; they also encourage good development habits, boost productivity, and serve as living documentation for the intended functionality of your code.

Thankfully, Flutter's testing APIs make it easy to write a comprehensive test suite.

**Summary**

- Use a "given-when-then" structure for tests
- Aim for 100% test coverage
- Bake testing into your development workflow
- Review tests in PRs carefully
- Don't skip tests to save time

## üß™ Formula for a good test

A good test has 3 steps:

1. Set up
2. Act
3. Assert

This can also be thought of as a "given-when-then" structure. For example:

> **Given** the Home screen is displayed, **when** I tap the Floating Action Button, **then** the Add Todo widget should be displayed.

Here are some signs you might be writing a bad test:

- The goal of the test is unclear
- The test has multiple reasons to fail
- The test contains artificial delays
- The test has hidden or internal dependencies
- There are no assertions, expectations, of verifications
- The order in which a test is executed affects its result

## üíØ Aim for 100% test coverage

Test coverage is a fairly blunt measure of how effective your tests are, but it's the best one we have. Increasing test coverage can never be a bad thing, and the higher the coverage, the more confident we can be in our code.

#### Tips for higher test coverage coverage

- If you're struggling, bring in another developer to help
- **Don't test individual classes!** This is a common trap developers fall into. Test at the widget-level using real internal dependencies.
- Only mock external dependecies. Mocking internal dependencies couples your test to the implementation and means that making changes down-the-line is much harder. If you find yourself needing a mock for an internal dependency, consider whether you're testing at the right level.
- Practice Test-Driven Development, particularly when making changes to existing functionality or fixing bugs. It's a great way of ensuring tests continue to pass and that edge-cases are covered as they are discovered.
- For code which genuinely cannot be tested (e.g. packages which use top-level or static methods, or platform channels), make use of the `// coverage:ignore-*` rules. This excludes the file from being included in coverage measurements. **Watch out for abuses of this functionality when reviewing PRs!**
  - `// coverage:ignore-file`
  - `// coverage:ignore-start` and `// coverage:ignore-end`
  - `// coverage:ignore-line`


## üßÅ Bake testing into your development workflow

Tests are easiest to write when the functionality under test is already in your mind. It's much more taxing to go back and write tests for a bunch of functionality you wrote a few days or weeks ago.

To that end, bake testing into your development workflow. You could use a framework like Test-driven Development (TDD), or simply write tests for each class immediately after you've written the production code. Do whatever works for you.

## üî¨ Review tests in PRs carefully

Even with 100% line coverage, it's extremely important that tests are reviewed manually during the code review process. When reviewing tests, look out for these red flags:

- Tests with no assertions, expectations, or verifications
- Tests which have obviously been written just to satisfy the coverage requirement
- Not all logical branches are tested (e.g. only the right-hand-side of a ternary operator)
- Only testing the "happy path"
- Abuses of the `// coverage:ignore-*` rules

## üëé Don't skip tests to save time

Skipping tests saves you time today, but this time saving doesn't come for free. You exchange this time for technical debt.

Fundamentally, an untested codebase cannot scale efficiently, and will become more and more difficult to work with over time. The time you save now by not writing a test will need to be paid back - with significant interest - later down the line.

Be firm on this principle when working with non-technical staff. Project timelines should and must include sufficient time for developers to write high-quality, well-tested code, and any estimates you give must include time for adding/updating tests. There is no such thing as "pushing to get this over the line"; writing good code takes as long as it needs to.
