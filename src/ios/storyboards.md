# Storyboards

At Netsells, we use Storyboards as the main method to create the UI of our applications. Thats not to say that we use them exclusively 100% of the time.

Storyboards should be:

* Small and limited to a single concern e.g Login flow
* Use Storyboard References if they need to be linked
* Well thought out and named

## Xib's

Use Xib's for:
* Custom views
* View Controllers that will be reused
* Table View Cells that will be reused
