# Directory Structure

In order to maintain a tidy / organised project. We keep the following structure:

```
+--- ProjectName
    +--- Controllers
        +--- Registration
            +--- RegistrationViewController.swift
            +--- RegisterWithFacebookViewController.swift
            +--- CreatePasswordViewController.swift
    +--- Views
        +--- UITableViewCells
            +--- DashboardHeaderTableViewCell.swift
    +--- Storyboards
        +--- Auth.storyboard
        +--- Dashboard.storyboard
```

This structure is already defined in the base project so you should just have to extend what is already there.
