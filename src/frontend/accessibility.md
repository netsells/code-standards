At Netsells, we believe that the web is for everyone, and that accessibility should not be a second class citizen when it comes to interacting with the web. We keep accessibility at the forefront of our minds even from the design stage.

When it comes to development, where possible we aim to ensure our websites meet AA criteria at a minimum.
