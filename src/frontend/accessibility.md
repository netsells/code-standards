# Accessibility

At Netsells, we believe that the web is for everyone, and that accessibility should not be a second class citizen when it comes to interacting with the web. We are committed to ensuring that everyone, including persons with disabilities, has full and equal access to our digital products.

When it comes to development, we strive to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG) 2.1 AA standards to ensure our digital products are compliant with the EU Web Accessibility Directive.

Our full policy and the guidelines which we adhere to can be viewed on our confluence page
