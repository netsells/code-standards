# Required QA

We require that frontend projects utilise the following automated QA at a minimum to ensure that code is at a base standard throughout.

## Eslint

Projects should extend our defined Eslint config ruleset.

See the [Eslint Config](./linting/eslint/README.md) page for more information.

## Stylelint

Projects should extend our defined Stylelint config ruleset.

See the [Eslint Config](./linting/eslint/README.md) page for more information.

## Visual Regression Testing

Where possible, projects should make use of our [Visual Regression Testing](./automated-workflows.md#visual-regression-testing) workflow to ensure changes do not cause regressions elsewhere in the app.
