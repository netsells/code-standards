# Git

## Commit Messages
### Formatting
Commits must be prefixed with the JIRA task ID, and formatted as follows:

>YPS-123 - Add additional validation to booking endpoints

### Tense
Commit messages should be written in present tense.

You may find it helpful when you're writing commit messages to prefix it with a silent "This commit will" (So don't include it in the actual commit messages)

>~~This commit will~~ Change registration validation
